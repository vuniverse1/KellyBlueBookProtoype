# Advanced Java 35B Project
I have completed a web development project for my Advanced Java class, creating a Kelley Blue Book website prototype using Java. 
This project involves object-oriented programming, multithreading, Tomcat, client-server socket programming, and servlets.

Client uploads automobile properties to the server, then servlet requests and receives the auto data, parses, and displays in dynamic web page using Tomcat.
