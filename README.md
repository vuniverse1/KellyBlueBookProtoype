This project is a prototype of a Kelley Blue Book website implemented in Java. I am working on this project for my Advanced Java class this quarter.
It demonstrates the use of interfaces, high-level interface implementations, custom APIs, and custom exception handling.


Interfaces: Demonstrates the use of interfaces to define contracts for different components of the system.
High-level Interface Implementations: Shows how to implement high-level interfaces to provide functionality for the application.
Custom APIs: Utilizes custom APIs to interact with external systems or services.
Custom Exception Handling: Implements custom exception handling to manage errors and provide meaningful feedback to users.
