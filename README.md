I have completed a web development project for my Advanced Java class, creating a Kelley Blue Book website prototype using Java, object-oriented programming, Tomcat, client-server socket, and servlet. The project demonstrates interfaces, high-level interface implementations, custom APIs, and custom exception handling. I am now working to incorporate Spring Boot.
